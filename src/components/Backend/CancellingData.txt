Key Parts Explained
1.** const controller = new AbortController();**
Creates an AbortController instance, a built-in JavaScript class for canceling async operations like API requests.
The controller has a signal property used to signal cancellation.

2.signal: controller.signalPasses the controller.signal to axios.get as a config option.
This tells axios to monitor the signal. If controller.abort() is called, the request is canceled, and the Promise rejects with a CanceledError.

3.if (error instanceof CanceledError) return;In the .catch() callback, this checks if the error is a CanceledError (thrown when the request is aborted).
If it is, return stops further execution, so setError isn’t called. This prevents setting an error message for intentional cancellations (e.g., when the component unmounts).

4.return () => controller.abort();This is the cleanup function returned by useEffect.
It runs when the component unmounts (or if useEffect re-runs, which it doesn’t here due to []).
controller.abort() cancels the axios request by triggering the signal, causing a CanceledError.

Why Cleanup?
-Problem: If the component unmounts (e.g., user navigates away) while the axios request is still running, the .then() or .catch() might try to update state (setUsers or setError), causing a warning like “Can’t perform a React state update on an unmounted component.”
-Solution: The cleanup function (controller.abort()) cancels the request before unmounting, so .then() or .catch() won’t run if the request was aborted.
-The CanceledError check: Ensures that if the request was canceled (intentionally), you don’t treat it as a real error and set an error message.

How It Works Together
-When useEffect runs, it starts the axios request with controller.signal.
-If the component unmounts, the cleanup function (() => controller.abort()) runs, canceling the request.
-If the request is canceled, axios throws a CanceledError, caught by .catch().
-The if (error instanceof CanceledError) return; check ignores the cancellation error, preventing setError from updating the state unnecessarily.
